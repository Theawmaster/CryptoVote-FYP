# üó≥Ô∏è CryptoVote ‚Äì Cryptographic Electronic Voting System (NTU FYP)

**CryptoVote** is a cryptographic e-voting prototype developed as part of an undergraduate Final Year Project (FYP) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. It showcases key cryptographic principles like digital signatures, blind signatures, and homomorphic encryption applied to a simplified, privacy-preserving voting workflow.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Explore cryptographic techniques in voting systems
- Implement privacy-preserving voter authentication (digital signatures + 2FA)
- Allow encrypted vote casting using homomorphic encryption (Paillier)
- Ensure basic verifiability and auditability using cryptographic proofs

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is **for educational purposes only** and does not guarantee full security or scalability.
