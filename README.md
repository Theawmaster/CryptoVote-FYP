# CryptoVote ‚Äì Cryptographic Electronic Voting System (NTU FYP)

**CryptoVote** is a secure, privacy-preserving e-voting prototype developed for the Final Year Project (FYP) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. It integrates cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures, blind signatures, and homomorphic encryption into a full election lifecycle system.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This system is intended for academic purposes and not for national-scale deployments.

## Project Objectives

- Implement cryptographic voting with provable privacy and auditability
- Prevent vote coercion and impersonation using blind signatures and 2FA
- Enable anonymous yet verifiable vote tallying with homomorphic encryption
- Ensure tamper resistance and full audit trails for administrators

## Security Pillars

| Pillar           | Implementation                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**   | Votes are encrypted using Paillier Homomorphic Encryption                  |
| **Authenticity**      | Digital Signatures + OTP 2FA + Session IP logging                         |
| **Anonymity**         | Blinded tokens unlink voter identity from vote                            |
| **Auditability**      | Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for vote commitment verification               |
| **Tamper Resistance** | Admin actions logged with hash chaining + Tally locked post-election       |

## System Overview

### Voter Flow

1. `POST /register`  
   - Register with NTU email ‚Üí receive verification link  
2. `GET /verify-email?token=...`  
   - Confirm email ‚Üí receive TOTP QR  
3. `POST /login`  
   - Get nonce for signing  
4. `POST /login` with signed nonce  
   - Verify signature  
5. `POST /2fa-verify`  
   - Submit OTP  
6. `POST /claim-token`  
   - Receive blinded signed voting token  
7. `POST /cast_vote`  
   - Submit encrypted vote with signed token  

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Flow

1. `POST /admin/start-election/<id>`  
2. `GET /admin/election-status/<id>`  
3. `POST /admin/end-election/<id>`  
4. `POST /admin/tally-election/<id>`  
   - Tallies votes with Paillier HE  
   - Generates ZKPs for verification  
5. `GET /admin/audit-report/<id>`  
   - View JSON result with proofs  
6. `GET /admin/download-report/<id>?format=csv/pdf`  
   - Download full report  
7. `GET /admin/verify-proof`  
   - Verifier portal (manual hash checks)

## Testing & Coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=backend backend/tests/ -v
```

Fully tested with >90% coverage for:
