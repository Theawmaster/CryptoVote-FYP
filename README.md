# CryptoVote – Cryptographic Electronic Voting System (NTU FYP)

**CryptoVote** is a secure, privacy-preserving e-voting prototype developed as a Final Year Project (FYP) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. It integrates advanced cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures, blind signatures, and homomorphic encryption that spans across the full election lifecycle.

## Objectives

- Ensure **privacy** and **verifiability** using cryptographic constructs  
- Prevent vote manipulation, coercion, and impersonation  
- Support **end-to-end verifiability** with blind signatures and 2FA  
- Enable **anonymous** yet **auditable** homomorphic vote tallying  
- Provide traceable logs and proofs for **election integrity**

## Core Security Pillars

| Pillar              | Implementation Highlights                                                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Paillier Homomorphic Encryption ensures votes stay secret                        |
| **Authenticity**    | Digital Signature (RSA/ECDSA) + OTP (2FA) + Voter Nonce                         |
| **Anonymity**       | Blinded Token issuance breaks voter–vote linkage                                |
| **Auditability**    | ZKPs for vote proof, CSV/PDF logs, and election trail                           |
| **Integrity**       | Database-stored timestamps, token reuse prevention, admin action logging        |

## System Architecture

### Voter Operation Flow

1. **Register Account**
   ```
   POST /register
   ```
   - Input NTU email → system sends verification link

2. **Email Verification**
   ```
   GET /verify-email?token=...
   ```
   - Email confirmed → OTP QR code issued (via PyOTP)

3. **Authenticate with Digital Signature**
   ```
   POST /login
   ```
   - Server returns a nonce → user signs it → sends back with request

4. **OTP Verification**
   ```
   POST /2fa-verify
   ```
   - Verifies OTP from authenticator app (TOTP)

5. **Receive Blinded Token**
   ```
   POST /claim-token
   ```
   - User submits a blinded token → receives RSA-signed blind token

6. **Vote**
   ```
   POST /cast-vote
   ```
   - Encrypted 0/1 vote cast per candidate with signed token
   - Votes stored in `encrypted_candidate_votes` table
   - Tokens marked as used in `issued_tokens`

### Admin Operation Flow

1. **Start Election**
   ```
   POST /admin/start-election/<election_id>
   ```

2. **Monitor Election**
   ```
   GET /admin/election-status/<election_id>
   ```

3. **End Election**
   ```
   POST /admin/end-election/<election_id>
   ```

4. **Tally Votes**
   ```
   POST /admin/tally-election/<election_id>
   ```
   - Homomorphic vote tallying using Paillier
   - ZKPs generated for verification

5. **Audit Result**
   ```
   GET /admin/audit-report/<election_id>
   ```

6. **Download Report**
   ```
   GET /admin/download-report/<election_id>?format=csv/pdf
   ```

7. **Verify ZKP**
   ```
   GET /admin/verify-proof
   ```

## Database Schema Summary

| Table               | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `voter`             | Stores voter registration & public key info     |
| `issued_tokens`     | Stores blind tokens & usage status              |
| `encrypted_votes`   | Stores per-candidate Paillier-encrypted votes   |
| `election`          | Metadata and state of elections                 |
| `admin_log`         | Logs admin actions with timestamps              |

## Testing & Coverage

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=cryptovote/backend cryptovote/backend/tests/ -v
```
Run this at this directory:
```bash
/CryptoVote-FYPrefactor_ver_8 $ 
```

Tests include:
- Voter registration and OTP flow
- Token issuance and verification
- Vote encryption and replay protection
- Election state transitions
- ZKP generation and tally checks
- Admin action logging and audit validation
- Full coverage for `/login`, blind signature utils, and `audit_service.py`

> ✅ Current backend test coverage exceeds **secure e-voting standard**, with comprehensive unit tests and mocking.
